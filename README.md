# DBMS_Project
This project is a relational database design and implementation for NOVA, a nationwide chain of pharmacies. It models the key entities and relationships involved in the pharmacy ecosystem including pharmacies, pharmaceutical companies, drugs, patients, doctors, prescriptions, and contracts.

I created a normalized, efficient, and consistent schema that supports real-world constraints and business logic for drug sales, prescriptions, and contractual agreements.

Technologies Used:  
-Oracle SQL/PL/SQL  
-SQL Developer  
-ER Diagram tools (Lucidchart)
